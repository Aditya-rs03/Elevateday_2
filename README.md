So, I completed my task and searched for the signs in this given sample used, which can help us signify that email recieved has some vulnerabilities and discrepancies 
which will help the reciever to recognise the phishing email in easy steps -

* The sender's email address is suspicious.=> A legitimate email from Microsoft would come from an official domain, not from `@msupdate.net`. This is the biggest red flag.
* Urgent or threatening language.=> Scammers often try to create a sense of panic to make you act without thinking. The email's warning, "If this wasn't you, your account has been compromised," is a common tactic.
* Generic greetings.=> While this email uses your email address, many phishing emails will use a generic greeting like "Dear Customer"
* Suspicious links.=> The links in the email, while they might look like they go to Microsoft, likely lead to a different, malicious website.

If you have already clicked on a link or entered any information, you should change your password immediately, run a malware scan on your device, and consider enabling two-factor authentication on all your accounts for added security.

This email is likely a **phishing scam**. Here's what you should do and how to tell it's fake:

* Do not click on any links in the email. Clicking the links could take you to a fake website designed to steal your information or download malware.
*  Go directly to the official Microsoft website for this given email sample by typing the address into your browser's address bar yourself. Log in to your account and check your recent activity.
*  If you see any suspicious activity, immediately change your password.
*  After securing your account, delete the email.
